Run QuantumDetective.exe to play the game

Quantum Detective was started in Global Quantum Game Jam 2022

The following week 8.5 hours were used to have the game to be in a good state for archieval purposes.

Following is a prosal description of the state of the game to ease Quantum Games Hackaton judges investigation and judgement what development was done before the hackaton. It will include spoilers.

Way below is description post hackahton.

Quantum Detective is a simplish interactive fiction video game.

Its basic premise is that the details of the story change in a cyclical pattern representing a weird state that is composed of more simpler flat prosal descriptions. This is meant to be analogous of quantum superposition. In anticipation of possible improvements this technique is here named temporal multiplexing.

To drive its story QD uses the Ink language for the classical story progression part. In order to maximise the time that a piece of content stays rereadable the game wraps the text 4 times over the playing area. There is no scrolling or related functionalities.

The game is driven entirely by player choosing from given options by rewriting the wanted option. The choice to keep prose input was to keep the possibility of non-obvious commands for artistic game design style reasons. The game does not feature any of them.

The extent of the non-classical story driving is that the work assement grade is guaranteed to have all of the values of A, B, C, D and E.

The game features the rooms:
Title line
Waking
Walk to university
Hallway
Toilet
Cleaning Cellar
Classroom
Auditorium
Office
Hall of Fame
Cafeteria
for a total of 11 rooms

In social capacity the game features the characters of
Protagonist
Runa Cat Lady
Rascal the Impatient Student
Butler
Math Teacher
History Teacher
Chemistry Teacher
for a total of 6 social characters

In non-social capacity there are:
The victim
Merry Bauber
for a total of 2 non-social characters

Winnig of the game consists of pointing to the right murder suspect and the right murder motive. Total win requires to do this in all basis states. The design includes as the main method of gaining a total win by using the Hall of Fame to gain indidivual control over each basis story.

There is a per basis-state randomization of who the murderer is which is taken over the prevoius two character classes and the case of an accident.

In addition there are the plot points of
Storm
Werewolf
debt
affair
Which are each independently equiprobable to be true

The murder motive is a simple conditioning over these plus some from murderer identity. The murder motive makes very limited sense in some of the combinations.

Three additional detail pools are picked equirandomly
injury: slice, blunt, plain
protagonist name: Mary, Charles, Stanley, Ada, Lisa

They are essentially not connected to case solving.

A third win factor of murder weapon was disabled for having low interactions of cohesion to the rest of the story.

There are also 2 rooms which have 3 items each which don't have any connection to anything and are, at this stage, red herrings. Additionally there are 2 books which contain an overwhelming amount of information but have as a minority some useful bits in them.

Three of the interviewable charcters follow a pattern of three choice attitude choice, followed by a repeating 3 subject questioning choice.Three of the others only have a repeatable 3 subject questioning choice. Attitude choice is unique per interviewee. The subject choices are Alibi, Motive, Guilt.

There is a plot thread that is signifcantly differently structured. Merry may or may not be a werewolf and may or may not have doen the murder. Unlocking the next piece of information requires visiting the previous bit of information. Only if the  werewolf information bits are gotten first the option "that totally random student" changes to "Merry Bauber". The werewolf plot involves indirect allusions to Merry getting an idea from a math question framing that the chemistry teachers purple potion that the zoology professor has been smuggling for their students will cure her lucantropy.

The main way the player can identify who is the murderer is that in the minority of stories the guilty party answers differently. The content of standard and altered answers do not show a consistent pattern.

There is no effect of what goes on in one story how another story goes.

Not every detail is guaranteed to appear on the first run. The amount of stories is set to be a constant 5. This is thus a bit of replayablity.

Because the basis-state stories have causality correlations within them the superpositional stories also have their states entangled. For example the performance grade determines how high up the hall fo fame the player can proceed.

files in folder "design_support" have additional world building / prework that is not apparent or have not been integrated to the actual game. There is also a file "reference_list" that contains information what various obscure references are trying to get at.

=============== Hackathon end program state description start ====================

Now with different fonts and colors for different social characters.
Honor guard in hall of fame is actually a social character and shares feel with butler.

Reading rest marks the spot of new content to read.

Scrolling by numbers. Use second box to go backwards that many lines. new content is retained visible while scrolling.

Tachyonic telephone has you calling from the future.

More detailed motivations.

New social character Post worker with own room. Can't be guilty.

The post office has trouble with lively cats interupting their delivery. Runa takes issue with the method and provides an alternative.

Chemistry department is also dealing with mail bombs. Mail office wants to detect duds so that not every delivery needs to be dealt with silk gloves.

Express packages need to tunnel throught a solid wall to reach delivery bots.

Office table is locked with key in possession of victim. No access until decay.

Hallway has a grue middle arc.

Auditorium has a super pass code generator in it. Ask rascal about it.

Rascal might be in trouble and steal extra passcodes.

Auditorium has a quantum teleportation sender and office a quantum teleportation receiver. Sorry there is no anti-correlation source so all that machinery is inoperable. Have fun thinking it somehow is (sorry, actually sorry).

Math teacher provides a simple quantum circuit simulation. You should really use Qiskit or Quantum Odyssey rather if that picks your fancy.

Game start with more choices now. Less reading more choosing.

Game now runs on somewhat of a possibility-travel version of timewaves. They are all in the same time but otherwise pretty similar.
