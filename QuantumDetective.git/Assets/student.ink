   "Hey, its not like you are in a hurry for exams as the question source just left the mortal coil" # protagonist
   "But this still sucks highly" # rascal
     "I don't even like these books" # rascal
     You glance at a book resting on the table which seems to be about the mathematics of lunar phases. # narration
   {werewolf==true:
     Hey you never know when you might need some knowledge. So better prepare while you still can # protagonist
   }
   {protagonist_name=="Ada":

   And as the System itself you are the last one to advice about rebellion # rascal
   {affair==true:

   So what were you doing here before you got locked up? # protagonist

   Do you mind if I take a look? # protagonist
   Sure, check it out and despair # rascal
