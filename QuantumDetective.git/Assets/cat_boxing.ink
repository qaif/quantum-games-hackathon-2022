What you want from me? # postWorker
* Snarky 
    To deliver a solution to the murder mystery # protagonist
    Address unclear, return to sender # postWorker
* Serious
    For you to confess your guilt to the murder. # protagonist
    I don't have time for murders while the sorting is murdering my hands. # postWorker
* Professional
   What do you know about the murder? # protagonist
   Nothing, I know about letters. # postWorker

         I guess even letters know more about murder. # narration

=task
What if I don't want to sort the boxes? # protagonist
Then I don't want to talk with you. # postWorker
+ Sort boxes
   So how I sort boxes? # protagonist
   Take boxes from that window. # postWorker
   Do the checks required by the labels and then put them in correct chute # postWorker
   So what are the labels? # protagonist
   ->taskExplain
+ Leave
  -> hallway

There are: animal, handle with care and express. # postWorker
+ Lets go
   -> taskExecute
* What I do with animals?
   For animals check that the transition sedation is working. # postWorker
   Then if it is not put the animal to sleep. # postWorker
   How do I do that? # protagonist
   By applying the neurotoxin from that cabin. # postWorker
   Isn't that quite deadly and not that sedative # protagonist
   Look, this place is busy and if the sender does a failure in packaging I will get creative to keep this place running smooth # postWorker
    ~ animal_cruelty = true
   ** object
       It does seem like the animals are wanted alive at their destination. # protagonist
       Look, the zoology department already does a lot of heavy packages. # postWorker
       So I will choose to interpret that they are meaning for the animals to get taxidermisised. # postWorker
       If you have a problem with that I can arrange for you to find a bear in your bed. # postWorker
       *** Nope
       *** I would rather have a antilope in my car
            You just got upgraded to jaguar on your deck. # postWorker
            ~ post_revenge=true
       ---
   ** when in Rome...
   --
   We don't have infinite supplies so don't use up more of the stuff than needed. # postWorker
* What do I do with "handle with care"?
   We are running low on idle hands and the chemistry deparment has gotten sloppy with their labeling # postWorker
   So we can only afford to ship with silk gloves those that really need it # postWorker
   To be honest I don't think the chemists would mind if some of the packages got lost if even some of them got throught # postWorker
   ~ bomb_smuggle=true
   The packages that actually can be thrown around you can put in 'usual treatment' # postWorker 
   and the packges that you know can not be thrown around you pur in 'snail pace' # postWorker
   How do I determine what can take what? # protagonist
   I don't really know and I don't really care. # postWorker
   But no opening up those packages. # postWorker
* What do I do with 'express'?
   Just get them to their destination as fast as possible. # postWorker
   This place is so clogged that any packect moving is better than none. # postWorker
   But the more the merrier. # postWorker

Are you ready to begin? # postWorker
* Yes
