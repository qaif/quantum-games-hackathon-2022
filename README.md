### An insight to our game QodeUnlocked
The game idea originated from trying to connect quantum physics and computing ideas with the theme of the recent Quantum Game Jam hosted by Ijpiis- ‘Patterns’. Thinking about patterns, the pattern locks used to protect our phones came to mind. This lead to the idea of creating a game based on password protection but rather than entering swiping finger to enter the right pattern or tapping the right number code, QodeUnlocked brings with it a quantum twist which is to enter the right combination of quantum gates to take the given initial quantum state to set final quantum state.
The game targets beginners at the starting point in the path of exploring and learning quantum computing. The game begins by introducing basic quantum ideas such as superposition and eventually aims to incorporate advance topics in the field to help players develop a quantum intuition gradually. This makes the game educational and beginner-friendly. Currently, the game consists of three basic levels and we aim to add more levels to the game eventually to make it a full-fledged game in future. 
In the previous quantum game jam, we started with the above stated game idea and due to a mistake on our half, we had to work on realizing this idea in a very short time due to which, the development part of the game was scarce and had a lot to be worked on (this can be confirmed from the git-repo attached in the submission). We only had one game level with only took inputs and declared if the combination of quantum games was right or wrong. This time, we worked on developing a project which strongly holds the essence of a proper game with catchy visual frames, sound effects and effective guides to provide the player with a good idea of how the game is supposed to be played. All the frames used in the game have been designed from scratch and then gathered all the assets together in Unity and programmed. The sound effects are afresh added to the game and it is made sure that all sound effects used in the game are royalty-free and freely available for commercial and non-commercial use.
